# Chuck-Experimental-Organ
A midi organ written in the Chuck programming language ( chuck.cs.princeton.edu ). It allows for adding the undertone series to the sound for experimentation.

It works like a normal pipe organ, adding stops adds more to the tone of the keyboard. Though there is support for subharmonic tones so you can hear what it sounds like.
